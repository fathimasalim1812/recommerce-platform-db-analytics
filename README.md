# Hand Me Downs ‚Äì A Recommerce Platform (DMA Project)

This repository contains documentation of a database analytics project developed as part of the *Data Management for Analytics* course at Northeastern University.


## Overview
**Hand Me Downs** is a conceptual re-commerce platform connecting users who are leaving or entering a city, enabling them to buy and sell used products across categories (furniture, clothing, electronics, etc.). This model supports sustainability and budget-friendliness.

The project includes:
- Conceptual modeling (EER and UML)
- Relational modeling and normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- SQL implementation (MySQL queries for real-world use cases)
- NoSQL implementation (MongoDB queries)
- Analytics and visualization using Python (Jupyter Notebook)
